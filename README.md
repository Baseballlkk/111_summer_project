# 111_summer_project

## Main Goal of this Github
This github is mainly used to store the data that used in the 111 NTUAS summer research project.\
Program in the study will be obtained in codespace.

## Description of Summer Reseaching Project
This project is mainly exploring the roles of convective and radiative effects on tropical waves.\
To explore the roles of these effects, space-time power spectral ananlysis will be used to analyze the composition of Convective-Coupled Kelvin Waves (CCKWs)\
How can we using this skill to explore the characteristics of these effects?\
Different experiments will be used to be analyzed.\
Also, via this study, the main result is that these two effects will affect the coupled intensity and phase velocity.
