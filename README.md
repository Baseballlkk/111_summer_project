# 111_summer_project

## Main Goal of this Github
This github is mainly used to store the data that used in the 111 NTUAS summer research project.

## Description of Summer Reseaching Project
This project is mainly exploring the roles of convective and radiative effects on tropical waves.\
To explore the roles of these effects, space-time power spectral ananlysis will be used to analyze the composition of Convective-Coupled Kelvin Waves (CCKWs)\
